        <h1>*tips my fedora, one last time*</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Well it sure has been a wonderful few months under this name. Due to some personal reasons I am changing things.
            First off, my websites are ALL closing down for good. Varios.xyz Safyrelyons.com 5LT.dev are all no more. I felt like
            I should do this as my stress over all this... stuff, trying to make a company, trying to save the world at age 16
            trying to do too much at once. I need some time to rest, get the money I need, learn what I need to learn before
            making stuff like this again. I am even moving my GitHub account. I have done too much at one time, and I think it
            is best for me to stop what I am doing, and take a breather. Go outside, have fun, meet people, do fun things. It's time
            for the end of my carreer for now. Thank you all for being with me, this was wonderful but it is time for me to learn
            not just make.<br><br>
            As I have said a few times to a few people "The person who can stop what they love to come back later with more knowledge is more powerful than being omnipotent"
